## Abstract

This paper presents a radical ontological hypothesis proposing that **dark matter is not composed of particles but represents a specific geometric state of spacetime itself** - what we term **Quasi-Matter (qM)**. 

In contrast to conventional particle models, qM postulates that dark matter emerges from **"partially crumpled" spacetime geometry** - an intermediate state between flat spacetime (vacuum) and fully condensed matter. This framework naturally explains the key observational properties of dark matter: gravitational interaction without electromagnetic coupling, collisionless behavior, and the formation of diffuse halos.

## Key Concepts

- **qM (Quasi-Matter)**: Intermediate spacetime state identified as dark matter
- **FST (Flattened Spacetime)**: Fundamental vacuum state (Layer 0)
- **CST (Crumpled Spacetime)**: Fully condensed matter state (Layer 3)
- **Layered Energy Structure**: Discrete transitions between spacetime states
- **Geometric Unification**: Matter, dark matter, and dark energy as different spacetime configurations

## Predictive Power

The qM hypothesis provides natural explanations for:
- **Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs)** as pure qM manifestations
- **Tully-Fisher Relation** as fundamental qM-stellar matter connection
- **Dark Energy** as potential quasi-antimatter (qAn) repulsion
- **Hierarchical Structure Formation** with qM as cosmic scaffolding

## Philosophical Framework

This work represents a paradigm shift from "particles in spacetime" to "spacetime as substance," offering a coherent ontological framework that unifies cosmological phenomena through geometric principles.
